# Sortify
A Sorting Visualiser Web Application

Sortify is a web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It aims to help users understand and visualize the process of sorting data, making it an educational tool for learning and exploring different sorting techniques.

Features :
1. Interactive Visualization: Sortify allows users to interact with the sorting algorithms by providing an intuitive and dynamic visual representation of the sorting process. Users can observe how data elements are rearranged and sorted step-by-step, gaining insights into algorithmic behavior.

2. Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The web application supports a variety of popular sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Users can choose and compare different algorithms to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and efficiency.

3. Adjustable Speed and Data Size: Sortify provides adjustable speed controls to control the animation speed of the sorting process. Users can slow down or speed up the visualization according to their preference. 
Additionally, users can choose the size of the dataset to sort, allowing them to observe how different algorithms handle different amounts of data.

Technologies Used :
Sortify is built using the following technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern front-end framework like React
